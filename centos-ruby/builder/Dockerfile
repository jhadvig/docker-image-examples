# Self-contained Ruby builder image.
#
# You can use this image to produce an application image providing the source
# code:
#
# $ docker run -v $(pwd):/tmp/src openshift/centos-ruby-builder
# <your application is being build>
#
# $ docker commit <id> your_application
#
# Then you can start your application using:
#
# $ docker run -p :9292 your_application
#
#
FROM openshift/centos-ruby-extended
